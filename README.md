# Nikola Jokic Performance Prediction Model

# Overview

A predictive modeling pipeline that projects Nikola Jokic's Points + Rebounds + Assists (PRA) using recent performance trends, opponent history, and machine learning. This tool is useful for fans, analysts, and bettors interested in data-driven projections.

# Features

Scrapes and stores full-season Jokic game logs

Computes rolling averages, season averages, and head-to-head stats

Trains a linear regression model using walk-forward validation

Predicts PRA for upcoming games based on real-time features

Modular design for adding new features and expanding to other players

# How It Works

# Data Collection

scrapegamelogs.py pulls Jokic's full game history from the NBA API

jokic_gamelogs_without_teammate.py filters games based on teammate availability

# Feature Engineering

feature_pipeline.py calculates:

    Rolling 10-game PRA average

    Season average PRA

    Head-to-head average PRA vs each opponent

Outputs jokic_features_24-25.csv

# Model Training

train.py performs walk-forward linear regression:

    For each game: uses only prior games as training set

    Computes mean absolute error (MAE)

    Saves predictions to data/jokic_model_predictions.csv

# Prediction

main.py prompts: Who is Jokic's next opponent?

Uses most recent season/rolling stats + H2H vs selected team

Applies model weights to generate PRA prediction

# Example Usage

Scrape Jokic's full game log data from NBA API
$ python datacollection/scrapegamelogs.py
‚úÖ Saved: data/jokic_game_logs.csv

Generate updated feature values (rolling avg, season avg, head-to-head avg)
$ python data/feature_pipeline.py
‚úÖ Saved: data/jokic_features_24-25.csv

Train the model using walk-forward linear regression
$ python src/train.py
üìä Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 11.37

Predict Jokic's PRA for an upcoming game
$ python src/main.py
üìù Who is Jokic's next opponent (e.g., LAL)? LAC
üìä Predicted PRA: 52.94
