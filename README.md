# Nikola Jokic Performance Prediction Model

# Overview

This project uses machine learning to model Nikola Jokicâ€™s game-by-game performance, including points, rebounds, assists, and other key stats. It is designed for use in sports analytics and player prop line evaluation.

The model currently performs:

Data ingestion from structured CSV logs

Feature extraction and transformation

Initial model training and evaluation

# Data Source

Data is based on Jokicâ€™s official game logs scraped from NBA.com and stored in a CSV file. Features include:

Box score stats

Game date and opponent

Matchup type (home/away)

Win/loss outcomes

# Current Progress

âœ… Preprocessing and feature engineering

âœ… Game log parser (Python)

ðŸ”„ Initial model training and evaluation (in progress)

ðŸ”œ Integration with real-time APIs

# Features

Rolling averages (e.g., last 5 games)

Opponent-specific performance trends

Game location (home vs. away)

Win/loss binary indicator

Matchup parsing (e.g., @ vs vs.)

# Tech Stack
